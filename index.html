    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project explores customer service request data collected by the City of Seattle. Using data visualizations, we reveal trends across time, neighborhoods, service types, and departments to figure out what issues and areas need the most attention.</p>

    <h2>Service Request Trends and Analysis</h2>
    <p>As we analyze the growing volume of service requests, it's clear that the number of requests continues to rise year after year, with certain categories, such as unauthorized encampment, showing significant growth. To better understand these trends and take proactive measures, the interactive dashboard below allows you to explore the request count by type over various time periods. By filtering data for specific timeframes, you can track how different service request categories evolve, identify peak periods, and make data-driven decisions to allocate resources effectively and respond to emerging trends.</p>

    <p>The unauthorized encampment trend highlights the ongoing housing crisis in Seattle, which is driving the increase in service requests in this category. As more individuals struggle to find stable housing, encampments are becoming more prevalent and with them the associated challenges. In particular, Seattle is seeing a large amount of requests in illegal dumping, particularly of needles, which signals a significant drug problem in the city. Addressing the root causes of homelessness and addiction in the city is crucial to reducing the number of service requests related to unauthorized encampments and associated issues. The city can direct more resources toward comprehensive solutions that not only focus on immediate relief but also tackle the long-term causes of these problems.</p>

    <p>The city should also turn efforts towards parking and abandoned vehicles as these two are some of the most frequent requests. Abandoned vehicles occupy valuable parking spaces, particularly in densely populated neighborhoods, creating challenges for residents and businesses. The Seattle Police Department has increased requests to remove such vehicles which can be seen later on.</p>

    <p>The number of service requests historically increases in the summer although 2025 is increasing the earlier months at the moment due to not being complete. The number of service requests historically tends to rise during the summer months, and this trend can be attributed to several factors that commonly occur during this season. A few factors on why service requests might increase in the summer is due to warmer weather bringing in tourism, increased activity, outdoor infrastructure stress, and special events. Seattle may be able to alleviate some of these effects by expanding temporary resources in the summer and proactively maintaining/repairing in the off season.</p>

    <h2>Service Requests By Neighborhood</h2>
    <p>The map visualizes the concentration of service requests across different neighborhoods in Seattle, with Broadway standing out as the area with the highest number of service requests, totaling 16,296. This data highlights the challenges faced by Neighborhoods in Seattle. A key contributor to this high volume of requests is the unauthorized encampment issue in the downtown Seattle area, which has become a pressing concern. The map provides a clear view of where resources and interventions may be most needed to address this ongoing problem.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the majority of service requests in Seattle are concentrated around a few key issues: abandoned vehicles, parking enforcement, and graffiti. These concerns point to a combination of urban infrastructure challenges and social issues. Parking enforcement requests reflect ongoing frustrations around limited parking space availability and illegal parking behaviors particularly in high-density areas like North Seattle and Downtown Seattle. Graffiti, while often seen as an aesthetic issue, can signal other underlying problems such as vandalism, a lack of community oversight, and sometimes the presence of criminal activity.</p>

    <p>Moving the year slider allows us to observe the change in service requests across different neighborhoods over time. By adjusting the slider, we can see trends emerge, such as how certain neighborhoods experience spikes in requests during particular years. Requests in North Seattle have shown improvement over time however, downtown Seattle has consistently gotten worse with a steady increase in requests over the years. This trend may reflect persistent problems such as unauthorized encampments, parking violations, and abandoned vehicles, which continue to overwhelm the cityâ€™s resources. Despite the improvements in some neighborhoods, downtown Seattle remains a critical area of focus indicating a need for more intervention and strategic planning to address the growing issues in the area.</p>

    <h2>City Department Performance: Annual and Cumulative Overview</h2>
    <p>This section provides an analysis of the service requests handled by various city departments offering insight into their responsiveness and capacity to address key community concerns. By examining these trends, we can assess the workload distribution among departments and identify areas where additional resources or improvements are needed and ensure that the city is effectively meeting the demands of its residents.</p>

    <p>The Seattle Police Department has played a central role in managing a significant volume of service requests related to abandoned vehicles, the 72-hour parking ordinance, and general parking enforcement. These types of requests have been consistently high, highlighting the growing challenges of maintaining orderly public spaces in the city. The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) initially handled the issue of abandoned vehicles, but the responsibility has since been shifted to the Seattle Police Department. This was a good move by the city of Seattle as it helps SDOT focus more on its core functions of maintenance and infrastructure repair while the police department tackles the growing problem of abandoned vehicle service requests.</p>
